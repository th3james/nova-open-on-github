**Open On Github** allows you to open your currently open file on GitHub. This is heavily inspired by the `Gbrowse` functionality in [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive).

## Usage

To run Open On Github:

- Select the **Editor â†’ Open On Github** menu item; or
- Right-click and `Open On Github`
